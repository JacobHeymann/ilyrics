=Downloaded lyrics have weird characters. Why?=

Please download the latest version after v1.1 which has this issue fixed. 

=iLyrics doesn't exclude "ft." or "feat." from song names?=

This behavior is currently not yet supported in iLyrics, however this functionality is currently available through [http://code.google.com/p/itsfv/ iTSfv].

=Only accepts exact matches? Would be nice to see a way to choose from close matches.=

This feature is planned for the future.
